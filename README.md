Program Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Introduction 
You have been hired by the city to visualize some simple weather data. The data provides the 
average daily minimum and maximum temperatures for each month for about 30 years. You 
are to display this data using the following charts: 
    - Bar chart 
    - Scatter point plot  

Your software should also give the user flexibility in showing data for select months, and only 
showing max or min temperature. Figure 1 displays a sample of the finished project.  
Important note: Your completed project does NOT have to look exactly like the sample 
screenshots you see in this document. You can choose different colors/labeling styles. Feel 
free to be creative!  

### The Data 
The data used for this project has been downloaded from the following source: 
https://calgary.weatherstats.ca/charts/precipitation-monthly.html 
and has been simplified for your project. Please download the “.csv” file called CalgaryWeather.csv 
from D2L to use for this project.  

### Minimum Requirements 
    - Interface requirements: 
        • Appropriate axis and labels for the graph and data (see Figure 1) 
        • Options allowing the user to choose different types of plots  
            o Bar chart 
            o Scatter point plot  
        • Options to filter the data:
